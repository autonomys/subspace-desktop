The Subspace community is big on decentralization. That is why, it is an open-source project, and are trying our best to be as transparent as possible. To promote Subspace Network being a community driven project, we take any breaches of mutual respect very seriously. Below is the community code of conduct, which applies to our Github repos and organizations, Discord and Telegram channels, and any other Subspace-supported communication group.

### Be excellent to each other.

Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging this is an open-source project and that everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.

### Speak up if you see or hear something.

Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. Also, assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

### Practice saying "Yes, and" to each other instead of "No".

Build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.

### We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:

- Stalking/following
- Harassing comments
- Deliberate intimidation
- Sustained disruption of threads, channels, lists, etc.
- Offensive comments
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention
- and any inappropriate content that is not listed here (according to common-sense)

We empower and encourage you to report any behavior that makes you or others feel uncomfortable by emailing community@subspace.network.

Any person communicating in a disorderly manner, engaging in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, or otherwise failing to comply with this policy may be removed from any Subspace-supported platform or permanently banned.
