# How to Upgrade

## Upgrade from previous version of Subspace Desktop

1. Simply uninstall the old application from your computer
2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/subspace/subspace-desktop/releases) for your preferred platform (make sure to select "Latest" release with green label and not "Pre-release")
3. Install new version of Subspace Desktop
4. Run the application, it should detect your old plot and continue farming as usual

**UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE IN THE RELEASE NOTES:**
- You don't need to delete your existing plot
- You don't need to create a new identity
- You don't need to delete the config and log files

## Upgrade from CLI (subspace-node + subspace-farmer)

These instructions are for upgrading installation that followed [official guide](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/blob/main/docs/farming.md),
if you followed unofficial one, ask guide author for proper upgrade steps.

1. Remove old data to free space used by CLI:
    ```bash
    # Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
    ./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe
    # Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
    ./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain testnet
    ```
   Make sure to replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` and `NODE_FILE_NAME` with actual file names
2. Delete those files `FARMER_FILE_NAME` and `NODE_FILE_NAME`
3. Install Subspace Desktop
4. Choose `I've run a farmer before and still have my keys` on the first screen and use the same reward address (that you used for CLI) there

# Development

## Prerequisites

- nodejs 14+
- yarn
- rustc

### Linux

On Linux you'll have to install development version of `libwebkit2gtk-4.0` and `libappindicator` packages, which can be done on Ubuntu with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libappindicator3-dev \
    patchelf \
    librsvg2-dev
```

- libappindicator: needed to use the system tray feature.
- patchelf and librsvg: needed to bundle AppImage.
